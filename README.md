In hdu 1, you can find a table that contains information to identify the images by sequence, date, MJD, Field ID, observation number in the sequence, or cutout.

| Table of Content HDU:1 (Table) | Description                                                                | Type |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| HDU_Ext                 | Extension number of the image in the fits file.                                   | int  |
| Set_Number              | Stands for the sequence (or set number).                                          | str  |
| Date                    | Date of observation in YYMMMDD format.                                            | str  |
